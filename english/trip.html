<h2 style="color:#6A0888;"> Welcome to Merida! </h2>
<p>The reception will take place in the Hacienda Dzibikak which is located approximately 40 minutes away from Merida, so we highly recommend to find lodging in that city. Merida is the capital of the state of Yucatan and is one of the most popular destinations in Mexico. Its cultural, architectural, historical, archeological and social richness are impressive. It has been named "Cultural Capital of the Americas" two years in a row due to the enormous variety of activities and cultural evens that happen throughout the year.</p>

<p>Michelle's maternal family is originally from Yucatan so we have a special connection with the city. The heart is where the family is, but objectively, Yucatan has thousands of attractions for all ages and taste: great party, beach, culture, eco-tourism, and more. You can eat seafood, go to a cenote, visit an hacienda, museums, hike the archeological sites, explore the fauna which ranges from exotic birds to crocodiles, attend a dance show, or simply drink a margarita in one of downtown's terrace. Of all of these wonders, one that we particularly enjoy is the local cuisine. Michelle is willing to fight for the statement that yucatenca food is the best cuisine of the country and Jonathan has yucatecan pork as one of his favorite dishes. We challenge you to confirm or deny these declarations. Every dish has a very specific and special story and essence: you need to eat panuchos, salbutes, vaporcitos, chayitas, sopa de lima, cochinita, but negro, papadzules, queso relleno, poc-chuc, pan de caz&oacute;n, marquesitas... and basically everything that you find on your way! This is just a small selection ;)</p>

<p> Beyond the food, Merida is magical and charming. Its people is very particular, its structure is gorgeous and the vibe is just marvellous. The city is very safe and has multiple attractions that are worth all the effort. Walk, discover and get enchanted with all the things that the city has to offer. Just protect yourself from the heat... and the mosquitoes. </p>

<p> <strong> SPECIAL NOTE: </strong> Remember that 1 USD DOLLAR is **approximately** equal to 18 MXN PESOS.</p>
<h2 style="color:#B40486;"> Transportation </h2>

<p> <i> Vía Cancún: </i> There are multiple direct (and relatively cheap) routes from many foreign cities to Cancun. When you arrive to Cancun airport you have three options:1) Take an ADO bus directly from the airport to several stops in Merida including hotels and bus stations (Approximate travelling time: 4 hours, Cost: $640 MXN pesos), 2) Take a bus from Cancun' downtown (Approximate travelling time: 4 hours, Cost: $226 MXN pesos), o 3) Rent a car and drive to Mérida.</p>
<p> <i> Vía Mérida: </i> Probably the easiest option. Flights arrive to <i> Aeropuerto Internacional Manuel Crescencio Rejón </i> (Clave: MID), and from there you can get to your hotel via taxi o Uber.</p>

<h2 style="color: #FACC2E;"> Lodging </h2>
<p>There are several accomodation options with a wide range of prices. This is a small list of hotels that we know and of which we have good references. It is important to check reviews and comments from other guests; TripAdvisor can help with the selection. AirBnb has excellent options that are worth considering.  If you are planning to know and visit city attractions, we recommend staying close to Downtown or Paseo Montejo to have important points at a very convenient distance.</p>

  <li><a href='https://www.facebook.com/Kinich-Izamal-202926983057845/'><i>Kinich</i></a>: located in Izamal, an hour from Merida. This restaurant serves 100% Yucatecan food and is in the Top 3 of Michelle's favorite restaurants (worldwide). Everything is delicious. EVERYTHING. Honorific mention to the Dutch cheese and Mayan spinach empanadas, the papadzules with longaniza, the poc-chuc and the coconut ice-cream. It is worth every traveling second and sweat drop because of the heat (and Izamal is just wonderful). This is a perfect day trip!</li>
  <li><a href='http://www.apoala.mx'><i>Apoala</i></a>: food and drinks menu is creative and good. There are pretty fancy drinks based on mezcal and fruits, and the dishes are not limited to Yucatecan cuisine. The best moment to go is thursday night while the "Serenata de Santa Lucia" (trova serenade) is happening exactly in the park where the restaurant is. Arrive early to get a nice table and enjoy music and food. </li>
  <li><i>Other non-Yucatecan options:</i>: if you are a bit fed up with local cuisine, try La Tratto, La Recova, Trotter's, Brayan's, N&eacute;ctar, si ya se hartaron de la fritanga, prueben La Tratto, La Recova, Trotters, Oliva o Brayans.  </li>
