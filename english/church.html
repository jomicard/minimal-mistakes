<span style="color: #FACC2E;">Directions: </span> Arriving by car or Uber is very easy. Directions from Google Maps and Waze are accurate and easy to follow. If you don't live in Yucatan and you don' have a car there's going to be a bus departing from the Fiesta American hotel that will depart an hour before the ceremony to the church where it will take place. Also, there are going to be vans trainsporting guests from the party to the hotel starting a couple of hours before the party is over.
