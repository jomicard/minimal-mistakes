  <span style="color:#6A0888;"> Day and time: </span> Saturday April 7th, 2018, 18:30 hrs. [sharp!]
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #B40486;"> Place: </span> San Francisco de Asis, Uman
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #FACC2E;">Directions: </span> Arriving by car or Uber is very easy. Directions from Google Maps and Waze are accurate and easy to follow. If you don't live in Yucatan or you don't have a car, there will also be a bus departing from the Fiesta Americana hotel in Merida and going to the church. The bus will depart around an hour before the ceremony (17:30 hrs.). At the end of the night/party there will also be vans EVERY HOUR transporting guests from the party back to two hotels (Fiesta Americana, and El Castellano) starting at 23:00 hrs.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#6A0888;"> Tip: </span> Protect yourself from mosquitoes! Doctors recommend taking shots or doses of Vitamin B12 two weeks before the party as a defense action. Don't forget to use repellent.
