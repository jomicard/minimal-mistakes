<span style="color: #B40486;"> Place: </span> San Francisco de Asis, Uman

<p>
<span style="color: #FACC2E;">Directions: </span> Arriving by car or Uber is very easy. Directions from Google Maps and Waze are accurate and easy to follow. If you don't live in Yucatan or you don't have a car, there will also be a bus departing from the Fiesta Americana hotel in Merida and going to the church. The bus will depart around an hour before the ceremony. At the end of the night/party there will also be vans transporting guests from the party back to the hotel.
