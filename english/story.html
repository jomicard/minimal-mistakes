    title: "Michelle says..."
    excerpt: 'We met during "recruitment weekend" at WashU. Jonathan was the first person I talked to and I liked him since minute 1. I came back to Mexico saying that I met a very nice German guy who was pretty hippie (this, of course, cannot be further from reality). As clich&eacute; as it may sound, I think that faith wanted us in the same places at the same time: talks, seminars, courses, buses... Honestly, at the beginning we were together due to coincidences, but it very quickly became by choice. We talked all the time and I used to tell him things like if he was an old friend. I always felt really comfortable when I was with him, and suddenly I was deeply in love with this charming guy. We officially started dating after a Basia Bulat concert and we have been together since then. We have explored and fell in love with St. Louis. We have met and enjoyed our respective families. We have travelled to many places, eaten and discovered new flavors, laughed, cried, studied, struggled, learned, and one million things more together. Jonathan has made my life better in all dimensions possible to the point that now I cannot imagine my life without him.&nbsp;'

    title: "... Jonathan says"
    excerpt: "During our orientation week at WashU, Michelle and I had to take a written English exam (together with 20-30 other international students). Before the start of the exam, I asked the teacher whether we would be allowed to use the restrooms during the exam. To my outrage, she answered 'no' (as if the exam itself was not already ridiculous enough). After the exam, it turned out that Michelle was on the teacher's side. She thought my question was childish and made fun of me... so we were definitely off to a great start! Things got even worse a few weeks later. The department's 'Welcome back' party was at a Cardinals game with nice All-Inclusive seats. Hotdogs, burgers, and drinks for hours, and the Cardinals won 4-2. Afterwards, Michelle said it was 'the worst and most boring afternoon of her life'!! :O I guess a lot has changed since then. Michelle is suddenly not only a die-hard Cardinals, but also Blues (hockey) fan and has seen bands live whose names she probably cannot even spell. In return, I have seen a few ballet shows, taken dance classes with her, and eaten more broccoli than in the 26 years before meeting her. Together, we have explored St. Louis, the Midwest, the US, Mexico, and Germany; and now we can't wait to see what the future will bring!"

    title: "The proposal"
    excerpt: 'It was February 23rd. Michelle had a meeting so she woke up a bit earlier than usual, got ready and checked the program that she left running the night before. She was incredibly focused on this task when Jonathan came to give her the tea that he prepares for her every morning. However, she was super confused and surprised when she saw Jonathan wearing his best suit. She asked him the reason to be so elegant and Jonathan, a bit nervous, answered that he had been looking for the PERFECT moment to tell her something, but that after thinking about it for a long time he reached the conclusion that actually every moment together was always perfect and that he wanted all of his life like that. Jonathan knew that it was really important for Michelle that this moment was a surprise, and it truly was!!! After that amazing speech Michelle was still sitting down, without saying a word and with a shock face. It seemed like she was not understanding what was happening (later, Jonathan confessed to her that he actually started worrying when he saw that Michelle did not have any other expression in her face beyond surprise. Michelle says that this was exactly the feeling she had and that she did not know if what was happening was real. She finally understood what "being in shock" means). Finally, a little voice inside her head told her to stand up, while Jonathan was kneeling, showing the most beautiful ring with the infinite sign and saying in perfect Spanish: "Silvia Michelle Torres Pacheco, would you accept this engagement ring and be my wife?" This was the moment where Michelle said in three different languages "Yes!", while hugging him and crying at the same time. It was an incredibly happy episode.'
