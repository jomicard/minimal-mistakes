</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #B40486;"> Place: </span> 
Hacienda Dzibikak, Carretera Umán-Hunucmá Km 5, Dzibikak, Umán, Yucatán 
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #FACC2E;">How to get there: </span> The website of the hacienda is <a href="https://www.haciendadzibikak.com" > here.</a>  The hacienda is located at approximately 40 min. from Merida but it is really easy to get there. If you are arriving by car, taxi or Uber, follow the indications to get to Uman, and once you get there you will soon see signals leading to "Hacienda Dzibikak". Google maps and Waze directions are very accurate.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#BCA9F5;"> Dress code: </span> Formal. The heat is going to be intense so we suggest that men wear formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayabera"> guayabera </a>, and women wear long and light dresses. The party will take place in the garden of the Hacienda so we strongly suggest wearing wedges, sandals or flats to prevent accidents and avoid damaging the grass.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:#6A0888;">Reminders: </span> We love kids but we ask you to leave them home. Don't forget high energy and good vibes!

<span style="color:#B40486;"> More details about the Hacienda: </span> Hacienda Dzibikak is located in the Umán Municipality within the town of Umán in the state of Yucatán in southeastern Mexico. It is one of the properties that arose during the nineteenth century during the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industria_henequenera_en_Yucatán" > henequen boom </a>. </p>
<p>The name (Dzibikak) is a word from the Mayan language meaning 'written with fire'. Dzibikak was a Mayan settlement that emerged five centuries ago as an agricultural trading center. Small settlements were planted with crops such as maize, beans and cotton to trade with the coastal towns for fish and salt. After the Spanish invasion, encomiendas were established in these settlement centers, which gave rise to the interior haciendas of the Hunucmá District.</p>
<p> Hacienda Dzibikak was operational in 1860 and in 1879 had a population of 231 people. The owner of Dzibikak in 1882 also owned Hacienda Sacnicté. </p>
<p> In 1910 the hacienda had a population of between 200 and 400 people. With the decline of the sisal industry and a fire in the warehouse which collapsed the walls and ceilings, the buildings were abandoned. </p>
<p> In 2005, Richard and Lena Nichols purchased the ruins of Hacienda Dzibikak. They spent the next 6 years renovating the property which is now available for weddings, photo sessions, quinceañeras or corporate events. It has hosted a ballet with 300 attendees and is the location for the annual Mérida Music Festival.</p>
